Otherwise, if the feature can take on many values, it makes sense to compare the distribution under spam to the distribution under ham. Create a *class conditional density plot* like the one below (which was created using `sns.distplot`), comparing the distribution of a feature among all spam emails to the distribution of the same feature among all ham emails. **You may use the Fraction of Uppercase Letters or create your own feature.**\n",

In order to get full credit on the accuracy part of this assignment, you must get at least **88%** accuracy on the evaluation set. To see your accuracy on the evaluation set, you will use your classifier to predict every email in the `evaluation` DataFrame and upload your predictions to Kaggle.\n",

    "1. Finding better words to use as features. Which words are the best at distinguishing emails? This requires digging into the email text itself. \n",
    "1. Better data processing. For example, many emails contain HTML as well as text. You can consider extracting out the text from the HTML to help you find better words. Or, you can match HTML tags themselves, or even some combination of the two.\n",

    "The plot above shows the different words that I used as features in my improved model and their the amount of those words in both the spam and ham emails. Each point represents the word that is used as a feature in my model and the location represents the quantity of spam (y-value) and ham (x-value) emails that contain that word. Words that are good features are (x, y) pairs that are opposite in magnitude; in other words, the x value is high while the y value is low and vice-versa since they reflect the unique nature of either a spam or ham email. In the plot above, the points in red (above y = x line) are used more often in spam emails instead of ham emails; on the other hand, the points in blue (below y = x line) are used more often in ham emails instead of spam emails. The implication for the feature is that the words with the (x, y) pairs that are opposite (high and low) in magnitude are the words that would increase the accuracy of the classifier; also, red points are more used in spam than in ham and blue points are more used in ham.\n",

    "# Question 9 (Making a Precision-Recall Curve)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can trade off between precision and recall. In most cases we won't be able to get both perfect precision (i.e. no false positives) and recall (i.e. no false negatives), so we have to compromise. For example, in the case of cancer screenings, false negatives are comparatively worse than false positives — a false negative means that a patient might not discover a disease until it's too late to treat, while a false positive means that a patient will probably have to take another screening.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that logistic regression calculates the probability that an example belongs to a certain class. Then, to classify an example we say that an email is spam if our classifier gives it $\\ge 0.5$ probability of being spam. However, *we can adjust that cutoff*: we can say that an email is spam only if our classifier gives it $\\ge 0.7$ probability of being spam, for example. This is how we can trade off false positives and false negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "The precision-recall curve shows this trade off for each possible cutoff probability. In the cell below, [plot a precision-recall curve](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_precision_recall.html#plot-the-precision-recall-curve) for your final classifier (the one you use to make predictions for Kaggle)."
